# Instructions

Explain what is Polymorphism and provide a code snippet
Your code snippet must fully function on Repl.it and successfully demonstrate the concept of Polymorphism

# Description

Polymorphism is the ability to use methods with the same names in different classes.  
This helps with code readability and reusable functionality.  
In this example both classes need to thave the same information (what model is the car).
The car_model function can take any object that contains the model method.  
This allows for both classes to use methods with the same name.
